Workflow for RL-based Traffic Light Control:

Simulate Traffic Environment:

    Use SUMO to create and simulate the traffic network (roads, intersections, and vehicles). TraCI will allow you to control traffic lights and retrieve real-time traffic data.

Define RL Environment:

    Use OpenAI Gym or create a custom environment where the state includes traffic density, waiting times, and the presence of emergency vehicles.

Implement RL Agent:

    Use Stable Baselines3 or Ray RLlib to implement RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, DQN) that will train agents to optimize traffic signal timings based on the traffic state.

Integrate Emergency Vehicle Detection:

    Use traffic data from SUMO to detect emergency vehicles (ambulances, etc.) and include a mechanism in the reward function to prioritize their movement through the intersections.

Train and Evaluate:

    Train your RL agent using the selected algorithm. Use PyTorch or TensorFlow for deep learning if required. After training, evaluate the modelâ€™s performance by observing metrics like reduced waiting time and emergency response times.

Scale Up:

    If controlling multiple intersections, use Ray RLlib for distributed training or multi-agent systems using PettingZoo.
